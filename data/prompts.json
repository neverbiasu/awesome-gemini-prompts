    "promptText": "I want to create a storybook for my young children. I've written a story and want Gemini/Nano Banana Pro (I have Gemini Plus) to create the images. We've determined a visual style and look for the protaganist, and this is used as a reference image. However, it relies on it too much. \n\nImage 1 is the reference image. I prompt something like:  \n*This is what I want Hubert to look like. Don't add other colors to his tail and mane and make sure he stays the same age/height throughout the images. This picture will be used as scene 1.1, him just standing in a meadow with the junkfood pictured. Use this image as reference for the artstyle and Hubert's looks, not for the composition. Every scene should have a distinct cloud formation and foliage, no repeated patterns. Please create scene 1.2 in which we see Poepoe running down a hill, chased by a toilet roll. We see Hubert spring into action to save Poepoe.*\n\nThen it comes back with image 2. It added colors to his tail and mane and most of the grass and plants in the foreground are exactly the same even though I specifically told it not to.\n\nI prompt it to change it, but it just keeps it mostly the same. Also, after a while of repainting it with prompts, it gets blocky and pixelated like in image 3. \n\n  \nHow do I get it to use a reference image for artstyle and character consistency, without it just duplicating elements? And how do I get it to repaint certain elements without it losing quality?\n\n  \nThanks in advance!\n\n",

    "promptText": "I've been digging into the \"My Activity\" page for Gemini (the one on `myactivity.google.com/product/gemini`) because I really appreciate the idea of having granular control – like being able to delete a single prompt instead of deleting a whole chat, which most other AIs don't let you do.\n\nHowever, I've run into some pretty significant issues and wanted to see if others have experienced the same, or if maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nHere's what I found:\n\n**Issue 1: Weird Prompt Grouping &amp; Deletion**\n\n* **Observation:** If you send the exact same prompt multiple times consecutively (even across different chats), the Activity log groups them all into *one single item*. The details show merged responses (latest first).\n* **The Problem:** If you try to delete that single grouped item, it deletes *all* the prompts that got grouped together from your chat(s). You can't delete just one specific instance if it got merged.\n* **Example:** Ask \"Test A\" three times in a row. Go to Activity. Delete the single \"Test A\" entry. All three prompts disappear from your chat.\n\nVideo Demonstration:\n\n[Issue 1: Weird Prompt Grouping &amp; Deletion](https://reddit.com/link/1oghh5r/video/zl3wd393wdxf1/player)\n\n**Issue 2: The \"Ghost Chat\" - UI Bug**\n\n* **Observation:** If you use the Activity log to delete *all* the prompts within a specific chat, the chat *is* deleted successfully.\n* **The Problem:** The sidebar list of chats doesn't update. It keeps showing a link to the deleted chat. Clicking it just gives an error (\"Couldn't load...\"), and the only way to make the dead chat disappear from the list is to completely reload the Gemini web app/restart the mobile app.\n* **Impact:** It just feels buggy and makes the sidebar inaccurate until you manually refresh everything.\n\nVideo Demonstration:\n\n[Issue 2: The \\\\\"Ghost Chat\\\\\" - UI Bug](https://reddit.com/link/1oghh5r/video/nh9symjfwdxf1/player)\n\n**Issue 3: Critical Data Loss When Deleting Mid-Chat Prompts**\n\n* **Observation:** Deleting the *very last* prompt of a chat from the Activity log works fine (removes only that one).\n* **The Problem:** If you delete a prompt from the *middle* of a chat via the Activity log (say, prompt #10 out of 20), Gemini deletes **that prompt AND every single prompt that came before it** (so prompts 1 through 10 would be gone).\n* **Impact:** This is potentially catastrophic. Imagine deleting prompt `60` in a `200-prompt chat`, only to find out that you've accidentally wiped out the first `60` prompts of your conversation history!\n\nVideo Demonstration:\n\n[Issue 3: Critical Data Loss When Deleting Mid-Chat Prompts](https://reddit.com/link/1oghh5r/video/o5h2851vwdxf1/player)\n\n**So, my questions for the community:**\n\n1. Do you guys actually **use the \"My Activity\" page** to manage your Gemini chats or delete specific prompts?\n2. Have any of you **noticed these same issues** (the grouping, the ghost chats, or the mid-chat deletion bug)?\n3. How serious do these issues **feel** to you? Am I overreacting, or are these real problems?\n4. And finally, **am I explaining this right, or am I making any mistakes** in my observations?\n\nReally appreciate the intended granular control feature, but these bugs make it pretty risky to use right now. Curious to hear your thoughts!",
